🎉 Welcome to the "Server-Side jQuery" project! 🎉

**Because who said jQuery was just for the browser?** 😄

With this magical Express.js overload, you can now use the famous dollar sign `$` not only to manipulate the DOM but also to take control of your server-side logic!

## Features

- ✨ Unleash the power of `$` on your server.
- 🚀 Create routes with the elegance of a jQuery selector.
- 😄 Enjoy the irony of using a client-side library in the server environment.

## Installation

To install Server-Side jQuery, simply run:

```bash
npm i jquery-server
``` 

## Getting started
```typescript
const $ = require('jquery-server');

// Use $ to create routes - because why not?
$('/').get((req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Server-Side jQuery!');
});

$('server').start(); // optionnal pass a port number
```
